# File I/O Practice Problems
(In roughly ascending order of difficulty)
1. Write a function `num_lines()` that takes a filename `f` as an argument and returns the number of lines in `f`.
2. Write a function `append_to_file()` that takes a filename `f` as an argument, and appends the word "banana" to the end of the file's contents. 
3. Write a function `remove_es()` that takes a filename `f` and overwrites `f` so that all instances of the letter "e" are removed.
4. Write a function `csv_transpose()` that takes a CSV file `f` and creates a second CSV (it can have any name) that is exactly like `f`, but with the rows and columns flipped.
5. Write a function `median_word()` that takes a filename `f` and returns the median-occurring word in `f`. The median-occurring word is defined as the word in the middle of the list of words in `f`, sorted by frequency.
